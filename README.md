# SkinScan
Face problem detection using machine learning models with ResNet, InceptionV3 and ViT. This project delivered a practical and accessible solution for users seeking to analyze and understand their skin health. 

This project utilizes 10000 image data using ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), and InceptionV3 architectures to develop a model for detecting facial problem. Among the models tested, the Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 0.85.
